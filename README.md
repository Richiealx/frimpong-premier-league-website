# frimpong-premier-league-website
A custom-designed Premier League themed webpage built with semantic HTML and modern CSS. This project demonstrates responsive design, grid layouts, reusable components, accessible markup, and organised code structure. Created as part of my CodeYourFuture training, it forms the foundation of my front-end development portfolio.
