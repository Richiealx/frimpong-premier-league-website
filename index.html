    <h2>Why I love the Premier League</h2>
    <p>
      Football has been my favourite hobby for as long as I can remember, and the 
      English Premier League is the competition that excites me the most. I love the 
      fast tempo, the passionate fans and the feeling that anything can happen in 
      the final minutes of a game. Every weekend I look forward to watching the 
      highlights, checking the table and talking about the big moments with friends 
      and family. The drama, the rivalries and the atmosphere make it feel more like 
      a story than just a sport.

  <!-- FAVOURITE CLUB SECTION -->
  <section id="favourite-club" class="card">
    <h2>My favourite Premier League club</h2>
    <p>
      My favourite team is <strong>Chelsea</strong>. I first fell in love with them during the
  <strong>2005/2006 Premier League season</strong>, when José Mourinho led the club to their
  second consecutive league title. Something about that team, the confidence, the solid
  defence and the electric atmosphere at Stamford Bridge pulled me in instantly. From that moment, watching Chelsea became more than just football; it turned into a weekly
  ritual. Over the years, I have enjoyed learning about the club’s rich history, iconic kits,
  unforgettable matches and legendary players who shaped each era. I try to follow every game
  I can and always keep an eye on transfer news and young academy talents coming through the
  ranks. Supporting Chelsea makes every season feel like a new chapter in a story I’ve been
  part of for almost two decades.

    <h2>My matchday routine</h2>
    <p>
      When my team plays, I like to turn the day into a small ritual. These are 
      the usual steps I follow:
    </p>

    <!-- This is the required list -->
    <ol class="matchday-list">
      <li>Check the early team news, injuries and predicted line-ups.</li>
      <li>Prepare a drink and a simple snack before kick-off.</li>
      <li>Watch the match live if possible, or follow a live commentary.</li>
      <li>Discuss key moments with friends on WhatsApp or social media.</li>
      <li>After the game, look at the updated league table and statistics.</li>
    </ol>

      Different seasons bring new stars, but a few players always stand out to me
